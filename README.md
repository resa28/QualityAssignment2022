**Assignment 1**
1) Very important, QA is one of the stages of any stander software development life cycle. It is one of the most important phase in SDLC as it insures the quality of the deliverable. without a QA there is a high chance that product released in the market my not be up to the stander or may contain huge number of defect.
More over QA reduces the overhead of testing the products by developers itself. This insures that the developers may put more effort in developing the application. So high output can be expected of the development team.
Last but not the lease without QA an organization may suffer huge loss in sense of business as untested products may not perform as expected or will be great delays in successive releases.

why QA is important for software development:
• QA teams identify bugs or defects in systems in the early stages of SDLC which saves the time and cost involved in fixing bugs in the later stage of SDLC.
• QA helps in maintaining product quality. Quality control tests are executed to ensure that the product is stable and works as expected
• QA validates that the product has no security loopholes or vulnerabilities which can be exploited by cyber attackers
• QA helps to improve the quality of the product which in turn helps to build the brand’s image
• QA helps in improving customer satisfaction as the quality product is released with the right QA in place

2) cara memastikan bahwa test scenario dan test cases yang dipersiapkan sudah mencakup seluruh aspek system yang Anda akan test?
* memastikan nama kasus uji di aplikasi
* memastikan fitur apakah sudah sesuai dengan kasus uji
* memastikan test step apakah sudah sesuai dengan test case 
* expected resultnya apakah sudah mencakup dengan requirement aplikasi dari setiap test steps yang ditulis
* cek status apakah sudah sesuai (jika sudah sesuai maka status berubah menjadi pass, jika tidak maka status fail)
